READ ME for Installation

These are the installation instructions for Cognoscenti.  There is a separate readme for doing the build.  These instructions assume that you have a cog.war file and are ready to put that into a running TomCat server.



=== Requirements ====

The only thing you need for Cognoscenti is:
1) a running and functional TomCat server
   for the purpose of documentation we will assume this is at C:\tomcat\ but of course you may have it installed at another location, substitute your location when appropriate.
   for the purpose of documentation, we will assume the web location is http://myserver:80/ but of course you may configured it to be at a different web address, substitute your address where appropriate.
2) access to an email server for sending email
3) (optionally) access to a POP server for receiving email

Data is all stored as files on a file system.  First decide where you would like your data folder to be.  By default all the folders will be placed in c:\CognoscentiData\ and for the purpose of this document we will assume they are there.  By default, the system will create four folders within there:

    c:\CognoscentiData\users\
    c:\CognoscentiData\sites\
    c:\CognoscentiData\olddata\
    c:\CognoscentiData\oldattach\   



==== Installation ====

Decide on the name of the application.  That is the name of the folder in the TomCat "webapps" folder.  For the rest of this we will assume that the name of this folder is "cog" however you can use whatever valid webapp name you would like to use.

Create a folder named after your application in the webapps folder (e.g. c:\tomcat\webapps\cog).

Unzip the contents of the war file to that folder.

You can at this point start, or restart the TomCat server, so that it will see the new application.  

Access the application at:  http://myserver:80/cog/

This will create the data folders if they don't already exist, and in the browser you will see a display showing the status of the server, probably announcing "Error Initializing Cognoscenti Server"  The latest up to date details are maintained on that screen, so it is a good resource to use.



==== Main Configuration ====

Find and edit the config.txt file at   c:\tomcat\webapps\cog\WEB-INF\config.txt

baseURL - You MUST set this to a real name of the server and everything up to the name of the application, including a final slash.  This URL will be used to redirect users to resources on this application.  Sometimes, the name that exists locally on the machine is not the name that the users see, because of proxy or a server in front filtering or rerouting requests.  This needs to be the URL address of the application from the point of view of the user's browser.  Do not use "localhost" because obviously nobody on a different computer will get this server.  Use whatever name of the host that the browser will need to resolve to this machine.   IP addresses will work, but obviously are not good when you have DHCP in use to assign a dynamic IP address to the machine.

superAdmin - we wil set this up in a moment, AFTER you have logged in for the first time.

identityProvider - this is the NEW way to log into Cognoscenti, but not fully implemented at the time.   This needs to be a SSOFI provider, which is open source and you can download and install if you can't access the internet, but in most situations it is probably best to leave this set to the global Fujitsu ID server default:

identityProvider=https://interstagebpm.com/eid/

emailOpenIDProvider - this is the URL to an OpenID provider that allows one to log in with an email address.  This needs to be a SSOFI provider, which is open source and you can download and install if you can't access the internet, but in most situations it is probably best to leave this set to the global Fujitsu ID server default:

emailOpenIDProvider=https://interstagebpm.com/eid/

If you restart the server, you should see the 'Welcome Screen'  however, you will not be able to log in just yet.


==== Configuring SSOFI ====

SSOFI is the module that allows a user to log in using an OpenID.  You can point to a number of OpenID providers.  Find and edit the file   c:\tomcat\webapps\cog\WEB-INF\ssofi.config

This is a JSON file, and you must follow JSON syntax.

ApplicationHomePage - this is the same as the baseURL above, the external address of the application

ApplicationName - You can leave this Cognoscenti, it is what the user will see when they log in

BaseURL - also the same as baseURL above, but without the trailing slash

tenants - contains an array of tenant objects, but Cognoscenti is a single tenant application as far as logging in is concerned, so you see only one tenant, and the id (only_tenant) is not important.  Inside the tenant there are a number of settings, but recommend you leave the defaults in order to log in to the global Fujitsu ID server.  If you run your own SSOFI server, you will need to make some changes here.


==== Configuring Email ====

Find and edit the file at   c:\tomcat\webapps\cog\WEB-INF\EmailNotification.properties

overrideAddress - while you are getting the server to work, you might want to set this to your own real email address.  If set, this will cause all email to go ONLY to that address, and never bug anyone else.  Later when you are ready for others to use it, comment out this setting

mail.smtp.auth - set to true if your email server requires authentication for sending

mail.smtp.user -  the user needed to access the email server for sending

mail.smtp.password - the password for sending

mail.smtp.host - the server DNS name

mail.smtp.port - probably 25

mail.smtp.from - this is the from address.  Some SMTP servers only allow sending email when the from address is set to particular values.  If you have troubles sending, try setting this address.

That is all you need to set for sending email.  Cognoscenti also has the ability to receive email, and to add the contents of the email to a project.  To enable this, you need access to a POP server.  These settings are:

mail.pop3.host=
mail.pop3.port=
mail.pop3.user=
mail.pop3.password=

Configing the POP receive of email is optional, and you can leave these empty for now.



==== Log In & Set Super Admin ====

From the welcome screen, click on the login link.  This should prompt you with the OpenId options,and choose one that you have an open id at.  When you are done logging in there, you will get a prompt (if all the settings are correct)  saying "You have been authenticated with ... but we can't find any profile that includes this ID"  This prompt will appear every time a new user hits Cognoscenti for the first time.   Click on the button to "create a new profile".

This creates a new profile for you.  Now we need to go back and give you administrator (super admin) priveledges.  Near the upper right corner, click on the link for "Settings".  Near the bottom of the page will appear a value for "Unique Id".  This is your internal ID and this is the value that must be placed in the superAdmin field. 

Again, find and edit  c:\tomcat\webapps\cog\WEB-INF\config.txt

Find the setting for superAdmin, and set it equal to the internal id for your profile.  It should look something like this:

superAdmin=YGOWVBWRG

Now restart the server, and refresh the web page.  A new option for Administration should appear.  The super admin does not have a lot to do, but super admin is the only person who can approve new Sites.  Once the site exists, the site owner approves projects, and so on.   Super admin also have some capabilities to observe the error logs, and to clean up the data when appropriate.



==== Initial Trials ====

You are done configuring the server.  Everything else can be done through the user interface.  To experiment, try:

1. Requesting a new Site
2. Approving that site for yourself in the Administration options
3. Visit that Site
4. Create a Project in the site
5. In the project, add a document
6. In the project, create a note
7. In the project, create a goal
8. Test the email by sending a document by email
9. If you set up receipt of email, send a document to the email address specified in the project, and see that the document becomes an attachment to the project.

etc.
